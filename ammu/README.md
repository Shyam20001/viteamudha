## Project Structure

Inside your project, you'll see the following directories and files:

```
├── public/
│   └── ...
└── src/
    ├── components/
    │   └── ...
    └── index.ts
```

- `src/components`: Recommended directory for components.

- `index.ts`: The entry point of your component library, make sure all the public components are exported from this file.

## Development

Development mode uses [Vite's development server](https://vitejs.dev/). For Qwik during development, the `dev` command will also server-side render (SSR) the output. The client-side development modules are loaded by the browser.

```
npm run dev
```

> Note: during dev mode, Vite will request many JS files, which does not represent a Qwik production build.

## Production

The production build should generate the production build of your component library in (./lib) and the typescript type definitions in (./lib-types).

```
npm run build
```

## Vercel Edge

This starter site is configured to deploy to [Vercel Edge Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/edge-functions), which means it will be rendered at an edge location near to your users.

## Installation

The adaptor will add a new `vite.config.ts` within the `adapters/` directory, and a new entry file will be created, such as:

```
└── adapters/
    └── vercel-edge/
        └── vite.config.ts
└── src/
    └── entry.vercel-edge.tsx
```

Additionally, within the `package.json`, the `build.server` script will be updated with the Vercel Edge build.

## Production build

To build the application for production, use the `build` command, this command will automatically run `npm run build.server` and `npm run build.client`:

```shell
npm run build
```

[Read the full guide here](https://github.com/BuilderIO/qwik/blob/main/starters/adapters/vercel-edge/README.md)

## Dev deploy

To deploy the application for development:

```shell
npm run deploy
```

Notice that you might need a [Vercel account](https://docs.Vercel.com/get-started/) in order to complete this step!

## Production deploy

The project is ready to be deployed to Vercel. However, you will need to create a git repository and push the code to it.

You can [deploy your site to Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/deployments/overview) either via a Git provider integration or through the Vercel CLI.
